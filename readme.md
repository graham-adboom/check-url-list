### Check URL List ###

This script takes a file that has a list of urls
1 url per line, and checks to see if any of them
reply with an error. If they do, it'll display in
red.

This script was intended to be used to check Google
Crawl Errors after an attempt at fixing them has been
made.


## Example Text File Contents ##

```
http://www.somedomain.com/page1
http://www.somedomain.com/page2
http://www.somedomain.com/page3
```
